									<p>I am a doctoral student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, studying Political Methodology and International Relations. </p>
									<p>I am passionate about using Bayesian Analysis to leverage the rich complexities of social sciences data in pursuit of solving the fundamental puzzles of our international political system, particularly international interventions, state-building, and the United Nations. </p>
									<p>Before pursuing my PhD at Washington University, I earned a Master’s in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at Columbia University, where my thesis used Bayesian analysis to study how international institutions adapt after endogenous shocks; a Master’s in International Relations at the University of Chicago, where my thesis explored how authoritarian regimes can make credible commitments; and a Bachelor’s with <a href="#cddrl">interdisciplinary honors</a> in International Relations at Stanford University, where my thesis presented original research on the United Nation’s efforts to promote democracy around the world.</p>
									<p>Outside of academia, I have extensive experience working as an analyst for the healthcare sector, working as a consultant to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid and an analyst at Kaiser Permanente where I supported surgical services.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Grass-roots Statebuilding in Post-conflict States</strong></h4>
				                    <p>State-building endeavors usually focus on top-down institution building, which have had mixed success and are controversial. What happens when instead state-building is from the bottom-up? I examine this question using original data on a United Nations state-building project in post-civil war Nepal. This is my job market paper and the first chapter of my dissertation.</p>
							
						    <h4><strong>Can International Interventions Build States? Evidence from the United Nations Development Programme</strong></h4>
				                    <p>Using an original dataset with geolocated UNDP projects and project expenditures, I seek to arbitrate a debate on whether international interventions can effectively build institutions and mitigate violence in failed and fragile states.</p>
						  
						    <h4><strong>A Multi-Task Gaussian Process Model for Inferring Time-Varying Treatment Effects in Panel Data</strong></h4>
				                    <p>In collaboration with Dr. Jacob Montgomery, Dr. Roman Garnett, and Yehu Chen, I am building with Matlab's gmpl software a Gaussian Process approach to the difference-in-differences model that relaxes the parallel trends and linearity assumptions.</p>

						     <h4><strong>Modelling Cycles of Violence in Israel and Palestine</strong></h4>
						     <p>In collaboration with Dr. Carly Wayne, I am building a causally identified time series model that captures the cycles of violence using an original, fine-grained event dataset.</p>
							
						     <h4><strong>Foreign Aid and Violence in Mali</strong></h4>
						     <p>In collaboration with Dr. Will Nomikos and Dr. Allison Namias Grossman, I am examining how elites in Mali view international interventions using an original survey of semi-structured interviews.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Senior Financial Analyst</strong>, Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara, CA<br /> Feb 2017 - Jul 2019</h4>
				                    <p>I supported surgical services with predictive and retrospective data to optimize the utilization of Kaiser’s 35 operating rooms, one of the organization’s most expensive resources, with analyses ranging from a few thousand to over 300 million observations.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Data and Policy Analyst</strong>, Acumen LLC Burlingame, CA<br /> Aug 2016 - Feb 2017</h4>
				                    <p>As an analyst and project manager on a contract with the Center for Program Integrity at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, I identified fraud in the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces and by Medicare and Medicaid providers</p>

									<h4><strong>Research Assistant</strong>, Prof. Don Davis of Columbia University, New York, NY<br /> Sep 2015 - May 2016</h4>
				                    <p>Using historical records and ArcGIS, I conducted exploratory geo-spatial analyses on various aspects of urban economics in New York City, including gentrification and female participation in the workforce. I also led workshops for the research team on ArcGIS software.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Research Administrator</strong>, Prof. Stephen Haber of Stanford University, Stanford, CA<br /> Feb 2015 - Aug 2015</h4>
				                    <p>As part of a research team, I researched the navigability of 19th century rivers in Sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and coded my findings in ArcGIS. This was part of a larger project studying the relationship between 19th century food security, economic market development, and contemporary regime types.</p>
