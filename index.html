									<p>I am a doctoral student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, studying Political Methodology and International Relations. </p>
									<p>I am passionate about using Bayesian Analysis and Gaussian Processes to leverage the rich complexities of social sciences data in pursuit of solving the fundamental puzzles of our international political system, such as how states make (and break) promises, how states build up and fall down, and how international institutions glue the world together. Most recently, as a student of Jacob Montgomery, I have been studying Gaussian Process models, particularly how to make them accessible for all social scientists to help them build better statistical models.</p>
									<p>Before pursuing my PhD at Washington University, I obtained a Master’s in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) at Columbia University, where my thesis used Bayesian analysis to study how an international institution (in this case, the Medieval Catholic Church) responded to an endogenous shock; a Master’s in International Relations at the University of Chicago, where my thesis used critical theory to explore how authoritarian regimes can make credible commitments; and a Bachelor’s with <a href="#cddrl">interdisciplinary honors</a> in International Relations at Stanford University, where my thesis presented original research on the United Nation’s efforts to promote democracy around the world.</p>
									<p>Outside of academia, I also have extensive experience working as an analyst for the healthcare sector, working as a consultant to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid as well as an analyst at Kaiser Permanente where I supported surgical services.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Classification with Imbalanced Panels</strong></h4>
				                    <p>Using Bayesian Decision Network models, a class of models used in meteorology and civil engineering to accurately predict rare weather events, I aim to build a more robust classification model that can precisely classify data even with imbalanced categories.</p>

						    <h4><strong>Gaussian Process Difference-in-Differences</strong></h4>
				                    <p>In collaboration with Dr. Jacob Montgomery, Dr. Roman Garnett, and Yehu Chen, I am building a Gaussian Process approach with gpytorch to the canonical difference-in-differences model that relaxes the parallel trends assumption.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Grass-roots Statebuilding in Failed and Fragile States</strong></h4>
				                    <p>Using Nepal as a case study, I am examining whether areas that the United Nations Development Programme implemented grass-roots post-civil war statebuilding projects in between 2006 and 2010 had longer periods of peace, as recorded by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset, compared to areas with no such project. All analysis is being conducted in QGIS and R.</p>

									<h4><strong>Modelling Cycles of Violence in Israel and Palestine</strong></h4>
									<p>In collaboration with Dr. Carly Wayne, I am building a causally identified time series model that captures the cycles of violence using an original, fine-grained event dataset that Dr. Wayne has compiled.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Senior Financial Analyst</strong>, Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara, CA<br /> Feb 2017 - Jul 2019</h4>
				                    <p>I supported surgical services with predictive and retrospective data to optimize the utilization of Kaiser’s 35 operating rooms, one of the organization’s most expensive resources, with analyses ranging from a few thousand to over 300 million observations.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Data and Policy Analyst</strong>, Acumen LLC Burlingame, CA<br /> Aug 2016 - Feb 2017</h4>
				                    <p>As an analyst and project manager on a contract with the Center for Program Integrity at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, I identified fraud in the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces and by Medicare and Medicaid providers</p>

									<h4><strong>Research Assistant</strong>, Prof. Don Davis of Columbia University, New York, NY<br /> Sep 2015 - May 2016</h4>
				                    <p>Using historical records and ArcGIS, I conducted exploratory geo-spatial analyses on various aspects of urban economics in New York City, including gentrification and female participation in the workforce. I also led workshops for the research team on ArcGIS software.</p>

				                    <h4><strong>Research Administrator</strong>, Prof. Stephen Haber of Stanford University, Stanford, CA<br /> Feb 2015 - Aug 2015</h4>
				                    <p>As part of a research team, I researched the navigability of 19th century rivers in Sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and coded my findings in ArcGIS. This was part of a larger project studying the relationship between 19th century food security, economic market development, and contemporary regime types.</p>
